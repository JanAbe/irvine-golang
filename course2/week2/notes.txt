Functions are first-class:
Treating a function as a first class value generally means that it can be treated as any other type (int, string etc.)

functions can return functions
might create a function with controllable parameters
You can make a function that makes the function you want

A closure is a function + its environment
When functions are passed/returned, their environment comes with them, the environment where it was defined.
