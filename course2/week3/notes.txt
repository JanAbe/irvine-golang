func (p Person) Talk() {
	fmt.Println("words...")
}

The receiver type specified in methods is implicitly passed to the method.
This happens by VALUE -> a copy is made and passed. 
In the example above p is implicitly passed as an argument to the Talk() method even though it is not written that way.
